Goals:
 - small embeddable library for quick and dirty fuzzing
 - intended to be used by developers for randomized (but repeatable) tests
   in build environment and continuous testing
 - have a command line reference tool
 - steal stuff from radamsa
 - have a FFI wrapper for at least Python

Likely required:
 - set random seed (optional, initially random)
 - get initial random state
 - change a chunk of memory
   - result must be free():d?
 - change an area of memory
   - no length change, only alter data
   - no freeing issues

Likely useful:
 - provide own open() and read() to be useful via via LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
    + use an environment variable to choose what to modify? 
 - own read() also useful to get deterministic block sizes
