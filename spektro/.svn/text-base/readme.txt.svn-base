Spektro -- a simple tool to assist in analysis of mass-spectrometry runs

This tool was written when we found out some local chemists solve these 
problems manually. It seemed to be useful and will probably be made more 
so at some point.

To build, first run make in owl directory and then in spektro directory.

Documentation will be added soon.
